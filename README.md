# Smart-Shoes-for-Visually-Impaired-Individuals
Smart Shoes is an assistive wearable designed for visually impaired individuals to enhance safe mobility. It uses ultrasonic sensors to detect obstacles in real time and provides alerts through vibration or sound. The system is low-cost, lightweight, and hands-free, supporting independent navigation indoors and outdoors.

1. INTRODUCTION
The number of visually impaired people is growing over the past decades. As reported by the world health organization (WHO), about 285 million people worldwide are estimated to be visually impaired. However, until now many schools and jobs cannot accommodate them mainly due to lack of assistive technologies and economic barriers. Even when the new aids or technologies become available, they are either too expensive ($3000and above), or affordable ($200) but with single or limited task functions only. Among all assistive devices, wearable devices are found to be the most useful because they are hand free or require minimum use of hands. Their main advantage is that the device points naturally at the viewing direction, thus eliminates the need of additional direction instructions, unlike other devices. This paper presents a new design of smart shoes that can provide assistance in multiple tasks while maintaining at a low building cost. The design uses the Arduino Uno, an ultrasonic sensor, and a buzzer to convey signal or warning to the user Through the integration of cutting-edge sensors and tools such as Arduino, the project facilitates real-time object detection, catering to the unique needs of visually impaired individuals. Furthermore, the inclusion of a buzzer alert system ensures timely warnings, enhancing safety and autonomy. Additionally, recognizing the challenges faced by the hearing impaired, the incorporation of a vibration sensor enables tactile feedback, allowing them to perceive alerts seamlessly. This innovative solution not only mitigates existing barriers but also empowers individuals with disabilities, fostering independence and confidence in navigating their surroundings. This report elucidates the implementation, and impact assessment of this groundbreaking endeavor, underscoring its significance in fostering an inclusive society. In response to the escalating demand for inclusive technologies, this research endeavors to bridge the accessibility gap by offering a cost-effective yet multifunctional solution tailored to the needs of visually impaired individuals. This holistic approach not only addresses immediate challenges but also cultivates a more inclusive society where individuals with disabilities can thrive with autonomy and dignity. Through rigorous implementation and comprehensive impact evaluation, this report aims to catalyze broader awareness and adoption of assistive technologies, thereby fostering a world where everyone can participate fully and equally in daily life. 

2) OBJECTIVE
The goal of this project is to create smart shoes that can   alert the visually and hearing-impaired individual while detection of any object. The sensors are capable of detecting moving, gripping things, and give audio feedback by using a buzzer or vibration sensor.
To accomplish this goal, you will need to:

2.1) Develop Sensor Integration:
2.2) Implement Arduino Technology:
2.3) Integrate Buzzer Alert System:
2.4) Incorporate Vibration Sensor for Deaf Individuals:
The objectives above encapsulate the core aims of the project, which center on enhancing accessibility and autonomy for visually and hearing-impaired individuals through innovative technology integration. By developing sensor integration, the project addresses the fundamental need for accurate object detection, laying the foundation for safer and more independent mobility. Arduino technology serves as a versatile and adaptable platform, enabling seamless integration of sensors and facilitating future enhancements and customization.
