Connections: 

Ultrasonic Sensors – 
VCC: Connect both sensor's VCC pin to Arduino’s 5V pin.
GND: CONNECT BOTH SENSORS GND pin to Arduino GND pin.
Trigger: Connect one sensor’s trigger pin to Arduino’s digital pin 2, and the other sensor’s trigger pin to Arduino digital pin 3.
Echo: Connect one sensor's Echo pin to Arduino’s digital pin 4, and the other sensor’s Echo pin to digital pin 5.

Buzzer-
VCC: Connect the positive terminal of the buzzer to Arduino’s digital pin 6.
GND: Connect the negative terminal of the buzzer to Arduino’s GND pin.

Vibration Motor-
VCC: Connect one terminal of the vibration motor to Arduino’s digital pin 7.
GND: Connect the other terminal of the vibration motor to Arduino’s GND pin.

Power Supply:
Battery: Connect the positive terminal of the battery to one terminal of switch.
Arduino: Connect the other terminal of the battery to Arduino’s VIN pin.
GND: Connect the negative terminal of the battery directly to Arduino’s GND pin.
